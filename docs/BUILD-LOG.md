# Build log

## 17 Oct 2026 · Batch 0 · Discovery and architecture

**Built** (documents only; no application code):
- `INVENTORY.md`
- `REQUIREMENTS.md`: 488 IDs plus 17 PROPOSED
- `QUESTIONS.md`: 45 questions
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `EXPERIENCE.md`: 10 EXP proposals
- `BATCH-PLAN.md`: 21 batches with a coverage proof
- `DECISIONS.md`
- `CONTENT-NEEDED.md`
- `scripts/ledger.py`

**Verified, and how:**
- Every source file was read in full:
  - the docx text was checked against its XML (184 paragraphs);
  - every sheet of the xlsx was dumped, and the silo counts were recomputed (106 = 46/47/13);
  - the design-system zip was extracted, and all 58 files were read, except the vendored minified React, whose version was checked.
- Ledger coverage was proved twice: by the generator's assertions, and by an independent regex re-parse of `REQUIREMENTS.md` (488 rows, 488 distinct, batch counts identical).
- The two existing repos were assessed read-only (no install or run). The live nilecruz.com headers and sitemap were checked.

**Completeness pass:**
- Each source was re-opened after the first draft. That pass added BRAND-021…026 (layout rhythm, spacing, states, figures, nav limit, ratings and guest count).
- Totals per source:
  - Dashboard guide: 204 (ROLE 6, ADM 107, OPR 27, CUS 17, B2B 13, PAY 14, PUB 12, BND 8)
  - Silo: 106 PAGE
  - Design system: 22 COMP, 12 TOK, 26 BRAND
  - CLAUDE.md and cross-cutting: ENG 18, A11Y 11, PERF 10, SEC 13, SEO 30, I18N 12, DATA 14
  - EXP: 10

**Deferred:** nothing.

**Known issues:**
- The code behind the live site (and behind the dashboard guide) is not in GitHub (Q1).
- The ledger's DASH batch assignments for 4b–4f will shrink if that code arrives.

**Where I stopped:** all Batch 0 documents are written and committed locally on `batch-00-discovery` in `/Users/islamhussein/nce-repo`. Nothing is pushed.

**Next:** Faris answers Q1–Q5 and approves the docs, then the Batch 1 brief.

## 17 Oct 2026 · Batch 0, update after Faris's first answers

- **Recorded:** ADR-007 to ADR-014. These cover BookingSummary, felucca removal, score-not-stars, obligatory separate gratuities (min US$5 pp/night), no flights in the cruise total, check-in to check-out, child pricing, private drafts until complete, and Japanese tracking.
- **Ledger:** 497 IDs (488 + BRAND-027/028 + DATA-015…021). I18N-008 was rewritten. 4 felucca PAGE rows are `Deferred` with Faris's OK. PROPOSED-009 is approved and now covered by DATA-019/020.
- **Re-verified:** the generator assertions passed, and an independent re-parse found 497 rows, 497 distinct and 4 deferred.
- **Still open before Batch 1:** Q1–Q5 (codebase, payment model, price visibility, vessel vs sailing page, name/slugs/redirects). Follow-ups Q46–Q50 are new.
